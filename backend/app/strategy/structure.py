"""Market structure analysis on the 1-minute chart after a liquidity
interaction with the first 30-min candle's high or low: determines whether
the move that took that liquidity is a genuine continuation (BOS) or a
reversal (CHOCH) - see breakout_sweep.find_trigger for what precedes this.

Definitions used here (matching the BOS/CHOCH-at-liquidity spec):
- BOS High: after price takes the HIGH, it closes beyond a swing HIGH first
  (before any break the other way) -> bullish continuation, no reversal risk
  to wait out. Direction = BUY. Mirrored for BOS Low (SELL).
- CHOCH High: after price takes the HIGH, it instead closes beyond a swing
  LOW first -> a candidate bearish reversal. This is only emitted once
  CONFIRMED by a second break, of a swing formed after the first one, in
  that same reversed direction (a fresh Lower Low) - a single break against
  the liquidity side isn't enough on its own, matching the spec's "Lower
  Low or bearish MSS confirms the reversal." Direction = SELL. Mirrored for
  CHOCH Low (BUY, confirmed by a fresh Higher High).

Deliberately conservative: an unconfirmed reversal candidate is never
downgraded back to a fresh BOS search if price reverts again - it either
confirms within the search window or the day produces no signal.

settings.require_displacement_candle (default True) additionally requires
the confirmation candle itself - the one whose close actually fires the BOS
or confirms the CHOCH - to have a "long body" relative to recent bars (see
_is_displacement_candle), rejecting weak, low-conviction closes beyond a
swing point that aren't backed by real displacement.
